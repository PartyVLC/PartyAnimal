# Party Animal
We are building a connected, shareable music application built with Node.JS leveraging the YouTube API.
### VLC
 - Our idea came about while using the well known open source media player VLC, specifically the playlisting and general workflow. There were some aspects of basic functionality that in our eye were not acceptable, specifically adding, removing and randomizing a set of media.
 - We set one main goal: To add features that would be used and enjoyed.
 - After we got started, and had a grasp on the VLC codebase we realized just how difficult it would have been to implement the changes that would have satisified our goal to both improve upon what was already there, and to make something that we thought was worth the months we would be investing.

### Node.js
 - Our second shot at implementation came out of one of our stretch goals in the original project, which included implementing a web interface that would better allow guests to add (and vote on) media in a playlist.
 - We knew that our product needed to be simple and easy to setup/use in order for people to want to adopt it.
 - Node.js was selected because of its rapid adoption in the industry, and because of the relatively simple setup process.
 - YouTube was selected as our primary media source becuase of its reliability and the extensive library of media that was very accessable through its well documented public API.
  - In the future we may look to add other options, but as it stands, YouTube is by far our best option as it will be supported indefinitely.
