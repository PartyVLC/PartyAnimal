# Party Animal
We are building a connected, shareable music application built around Node.JS leveraging the YouTube API.
## VLC:
 - Our idea came about while using the well known open source media player VLC, specifically the playlisting and general workflow. There were some aspects of basic functionality that in our eye were not acceptable, specifically adding, removing and randomizing a set of media.
 - We set one main goal: To add features that would be used and enjoyed.
 - After we got started, and had a grasp on the VLC codebase we realized just how difficult it would have been to implement the changes that would have satisified our goal to both improve upon what was already there, and to make something that we thought was worth the months we would be investing.

## Node.js:
 - Our second shot at implementing came out of one of our stretch goals in the original project, which included implementing a web interface that would better allow guests to add (and vote on) media in a playlist.
